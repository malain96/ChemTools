# ChemTools

## Description

ChemTools is a small app developed with C#/.NET Core. 
It currently has two different features :
* The first one "Benzoic Acid", allows the user to select TXT files and to transform them into Excel files. The "Chromatogram" button creates a chart from the TXT files and exports it to an Excel file. The "Integration" button creates a table from the TXT files and exports it to an Excel file.
* The second one "Nucleoside", allows the user to input a mass and a charge to find the closest oligonucleotide with the given mass.
